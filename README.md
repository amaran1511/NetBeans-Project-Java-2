This is a strategy game, it is based on the classical chess but with different rules as explained below.

First of all the two players start by entering their name, alias and age in the option 'Registro de Jugadores' (Registry of Players). If there're no players registered the program will tell the user that it can't proceed. Once the players are register they can enter the option 'Jugar' (Play), there the user will find the list of registered players. After selecting the players of the list, the user will have to choose the size between a 3x3 or a 5x5 board. By selecting 'Jugar' the player can then start the game.

The game's main goal is to 'eat' the others players tokens. Whoever has no token left looses, and the other player wins. But the players can only eat the tokens that are inside the red box showed in the board. Additionally, there are 2 types of tokens: rook and bishop. The tokens of the players start by having the characteristics of a rook, that means the tokens can move in a straight line. Once a rook is moved it transforms to a bishop. This token can move now in a diagonal. In other words every time the player moves a token it transforms from rook to bishop and vice versa. As a player one can ask the other player for a tie in 'Pedir empate' or once can simply abandon the game, in which case the opposite player wins. In the main menu of the game the option 'Ranking' provides the user information about the player's win games, defeat games and tie games.

In the interface of the board one can find a variety options. For instance one can mute the music with the icon, enter some options in 'Opciones partida' or configurate some features in 'Configuracion'. In 'Opciones partida' one can select to see the history of moves of the players, or even download it to the user's PC. If the player is in need of help one can also select 'Ayuda', which shows all the possible moves of defense in the column 'Defensa', attack in 'Ataque' or others in 'Otras'. Furthermore, in 'Configuracion' one could rotate the board in 'Rotar el tablero', change the color of the board in 'Cambiar el color del tablero' or even change the icons of the tokens in 'Cambiar el icono de las fichas'.

For more information I have provided files, for instance the UML of the code and the Testing of it. 

I encourage You to explore the game and enjoy it!
